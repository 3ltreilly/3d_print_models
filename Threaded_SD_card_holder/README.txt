# Summary

This is a threaded micro SD and SDHC card holder, I got my inspiration from both the SD card holder from n2b8 (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1322805) and the micro SD card holder from bgill (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1289250) I posted this as a remix to give them both credit as this is not an original model however it I made it from scratch using fusion 360 so the model is mine. 
I was looking around for a micro SD card and regular SD card holder to store my camera sd cards (I have two which use different sized cards) But I couldn't find a holder that either had a lid which would keep them together when travelling, or had slots for both types of card rather than one or the other. So I came across the two holders from n2b8 and bgill, which then gave me the idea to combine the two. please note the threads are a little tight and will need wearing in a bit, I did this by just twisting several times then ( or opening and closing it) but do this gradually as I found with PLA it fractured on the first time. once the threads have been worn in make sure to clean them as PLA dust can build up.

11/03/2018 - After reading a few comments i have uploaded the original Fusion file so people can make custom ones from it. Also will be uploading a blank one which is just a threaded container and maybe a few other iterations at some point. (if you have any ideas, message me or comment! )

# Print Settings

Printer: CTC Bizer
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
both files can be printed without supports as the fillets on them both aren't big enough over hangs to be an issue and a raft is also not necessary.
